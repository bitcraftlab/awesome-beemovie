[![awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)  list of bee movie translations at the intersection of art and annoyance.

The art of _bee movie translation_ involves remixing the [bee movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389790/) or its trailer based on the original movie script and the occurence of the word __bee__.

Similar techniques have been explored by adventurers dedicated to algorithmic poetry such as the OuLiPo movement. Bee movie translations add a layer of video remixing and transformation that goes beyond mere textual and abstract poetry.
